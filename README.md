### F.A.Q's

> Both [Cache Daemon Client Guide](https://github.com/Cache-core/Guides/blob/master/cache-daemon.md) and [Cache Wallet Client Guide](https://github.com/Cache-core/Guides/blob/master/cache-wallet.md) should also cover a lot of user F.A.Q's

- **How do you deposit coin onto the Cache blockchain?**
  - Currently, banking is only implemented in our Desktop wallet application. Once the wallet has finished synchronizing, you will then be able to click the "Banking" option within the side menu and continue to create a deposit.
- **How do you mine Cache?**
  - You can mine Cache either via the core daemon client if you want to solo-mine against the rest of the network, or by using mining software with "Cache Hash" support to mine in a pool with other miners, combining your hashes to find blocks together for a split reward.
- **How do you send a privately encrypted message over the blockchain?**
  - Currently, this feature is only implemented into the Desktop wallet application. Once the wallet has finished synchronizing, you will then be able to click the "Send Message" option within the side menu and continue to send private messages over the blockchain with an optional "Self-Destruct" to delete the message after X blocks.
