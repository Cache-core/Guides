## The Cache Project's Minor Paper
> A minor paper summarizing the future project and other various ideas.

### Idea
> Keep it simple.

- Mimic everyday cash
- Universally usable
- Create stable jobs
- Decentralised finance *(aka DeFi)*
- Become a medium for daily transactions

These are the 5 main ideas for our project.

### Elaborate

- **Mimic everyday cash**
    - This is a vital feature if we want the project to succeed. Everyday cash is fungible so therefore Bitcoin and Fiat are not the same. Privacy shouldn't be an option.
- **Universally usable**
    - The fact we have different currencies depending on what geolocation we are in is absurd. *"Why can't everyone use the same form of payment globally?"*
- **Creating stable jobs**
    - Jobs are not safe in this day and age depending on who we work for and where we work. I want the project to give anyone a chance to earn a stable income by working for the project and get paid to do so.
- **Decentralised finance**
    - The whole purpose in cryptographic currencies was to defeat the object of banks and what they represent. Having on-chain, legitimate financial features to mimic what banks claim they do would be one big step closer to beating them.
- **Become a medium for daily transactions**
    - This could fall under the same category as the second statement.
    
### Realistic

Most projects fade away because they usually lack the money to run the needed resources for that said project.
I have devised a plan to create a *premine* (everybody hates that word but we're being realistic) to help oversea our work for a number of years to support the idea of a stable income for project members and contributors.
These funds will also be used to help market the project to allow more potential new users as well as help pay for resources.
Will will document this premine and give public information out to allow users to *login to* a view-only version of the testnet wallet, which proves funds.

### Specs

| Attribute | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Supply | 500[M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000) | The total supply of the Blockchain should be a high figure to support the idea of longevity. The higher supply, the more coins that can be produced overtime. |
| Premine | 3% | The premine should only be a minor percentage of the supply but enough to sustain the project for years to come. Premine supports the project and its ideas/plans for the future. |
| Block Reward | 5.00000 | The Block Reward should be low in amount to counteract the high supply of the Blockchain. A Low Block Rewards means you won't be sat on *millions* of coin that barely hold value. |
| Emission Rate | +0.25 every ~2 months (60days) | An slowly increasing Block Reward overtime. This personally makes it a better suited option for when people miss out on the initial [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) of the project and also encourages miners to mine as the block reward isn't getting unfairly small so that the reward for smaller miners is miniscule. |
| Banking Term | 1 month - 1 year | To make things easy when it comes to banking, caps are in place to mimic real life banking systems. You can start gaining with as little as 1 full coin. |
| Fee | 0.001 | To save congestion on the Blockchain, there needs to be a reasonable fee. We may implement a dynamic fee further down the line but for now, it is statically set at 0.001 minimum |
| Decimals | 5 | Large decimal places are usually harder to count and work out. Keeping decimals simplistic will help normal people work out their funds better. |
| Hashing Algorithm | Cryptonight/Cache_Hash | Cache Hash is our very own, newly modified algorithm in attempts to further resist ASIC & FPGA software. |
