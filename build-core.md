***

#### Linux

##### Prerequisites

You will need the following packages: boost, cmake (3.8 or higher), make, and git.

You will also need either GCC/G++, or Clang.

If you are using GCC, you will need GCC-7.0 or higher.

If you are using Clang, you will need Clang 6.0 or higher. You will also need libstdc++\-6.0 or higher.

##### Ubuntu - GCC

- `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y`
- `sudo apt-get update`
- `sudo apt-get install aptitude -y`
- `sudo aptitude install -y build-essential gcc g++ git libboost-all-dev python-pip`
- `sudo pip install cmake`
- `git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/cache-core/cache`
- `cd cache`
- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`

The binaries will be in the `src` folder when you are complete.

- `cd src`
- `./cache-daemon --version`

***

#### MacOS

##### Prerequisites

- Install [cmake](https://cmake.org/). See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23849962/cmake-installer-for-mac-fails-to-create-usr-bin-symlinks) if you are unable call `cmake` from the terminal after installing.
- Install the [boost](http://www.boost.org/) libraries. Either compile boost manually or run `brew install boost`.
- Install XCode and Developer Tools.

##### Building

- `git clone -b master https://github.com/cache-core/cache`
- `cd cache`
- `mkdir build && cd $_`
- `cmake ..` or `cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=<path_to_boost_install> ..` when building
  from a specific boost install. If you used brew to install boost, your path is most likely `/usr/local/include/boost.`
- `make`

The binaries will be in `./src` after compilation is complete.

Run `./src/cache-daemon` to connect to the network and let it sync (it may take a while).

***

#### Windows x64

##### Prerequisites
- Install [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15&page=inlineinstall)
- When installing Visual Studio, it is **required** that you install **Desktop development with C++** and the **VC++ v140 toolchain** when selecting features. The option to install the v140 toolchain can be found by expanding the "Desktop development with C++" node on the right. You will need this for the project to build correctly. This item will be called something like `VC++ 2015.3 v14.00 (v140) toolset for desktop`
- Install [Boost 1.59.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.59.0/), ensuring you download the installer for MSVC 14.

##### Building

- From the start menu, open 'x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for vs2017'.
- `cd <your_cache_directory>`
- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- Set the PATH variable for cmake: ie. `set PATH="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin";%PATH%`
- `cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" .. -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/local/boost_1_59_0` (Or your boost installed dir.)
- `MSBuild Cache.sln /p:Configuration=Release /m`
- If all went well, it will complete successfully, and you will find all your binaries in the '..\build\src\Release' directory.
- Additionally, a `.sln` file will have been created in the `build` directory. If you wish to open the project in Visual Studio with this, you can.
